The `.s5p` file is actually in JSON format.
Therefore, before you commit your files, you can optionally reformat it for future ease of comparison.
```bash
python prettify-s5p.py -y -no-ascii
```
The script requires Python 3.7 (or whatever version that guarantees the `dict` store key-value pairs in insertion order)
You may omit `-y` and `-no-ascii` or have `-ascii` (which is overriden by `-no-ascii`), and the script will prompt you accordingly.
